# Stock/Option Modeling Master's Research Project

So far, I have two different Jupyter notebooks, which show the beginning of my exploration into modeling the volatility of stocks.

The end goal of this project is to use machine learning to price options as accurately as possible and see if using machine learning can improve pricing compared to traditional methods.
